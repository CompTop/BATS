// utilities for extending chain maps

// relies on correspondences

// function to extend chain map up one dimension given a correspondence
// always check that carrier is acyclic
// this is not necessary for inclusions. However, all simplices must be there

// examples of maps to test:
// x2 map on S^1 (correspondence should be a bit broad)
// antipodal projection of S^n to RP^n
// inclusion of S^n to D^{n+1}
