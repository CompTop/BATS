# BATS Basic Applied Topology Subprograms

Provides driver routines for the following:
* Create matrices from cell complexes/filtrations
* Matrix factorizations/reductions used in TDA
* Extraction of information from reduced matrices (barcodes)

Goals:
* Support for General cell complex implementations
* Filtrations for any cell complex implementation
* Support for general field coefficients
* Support for general matrix implementations

# Contributing
Code should use C++17 standard

Much of the code should be written in a templated manner in a header file.

# Build From Source

Use CMake

# Documentation

Make with Doxygen

# Tests

Make with Doctest
